# 👋 Hi, I’m Nolan Dubeau  
### Forward-Deployed Agentic Engineer • Full-Stack Product Builder • Founder, Advanced Creative Labs  

I design and ship **AI-native software end-to-end** — blending product strategy, system architecture, and creative engineering. My focus is on building the connective tissue between humans, agents, and code.  

I’ve led initiatives spanning:  
- 🧠 **Agentic Infrastructure:** LangGraph orchestration, Model Context Protocol servers, and agent pipelines  
- ⚙️ **Full-Stack Systems:** Next.js, TypeScript, Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Vercel AI SDK  
- 🎨 **Creative Intelligence:** Brand research, generative content workflows, and “Agent-Ready Web” (ARW) standards  
- 🧩 **AI Observability:** Real-time logging, embedding hydration, and telemetry for multi-agent systems

## 🔭 Current Work
**Advanced Creative Labs (ACL)** — building *Hi5*, a generative creative-intelligence platform that powers brand and marketing workflows with agentic AI.  
**Agent-Ready Web (ARW)** — defining an open specification for making web content discoverable, understandable, and actionable by AI agents.  
**AgentScope** — an experimental analytics layer that unifies RAG, event telemetry, and knowledge graphs for agents and brands.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Languages & Frameworks:** TypeScript, Python, Rust  
**Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind  
**Backend:** FastAPI, LangGraph, MCP, WebSockets  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, LanceDB, Supabase, Neon  
**Infra:** Docker, Cloudflare, Vercel, GitHub Actions  
**AI / Agents:** Claude, GPT, Cursor, Claude Code, Opencode, Helicone, Sentry

## 🧬 Philosophy
> “AI isn’t replacing people. It’s replacing the distance between idea and outcome.”

I believe software is both art and system design.  
The next era of engineering belongs to *composers* — those who orchestrate humans, agents, and machines into new creative systems.
